# Day trips & regional highlights

Boulder makes an excellent home base for exploring the Front Range. Many of Colorado’s most iconic landscapes, mountain towns, and cultural destinations are an easy half-day or day trip from here. Drive times below assume good weather and off-peak conditions — during storms, holidays, or major events, travel can take longer.

## [Rocky Mountain National Park](https://www.nps.gov/romo)
- 🚗 ~45–75 minutes (depending on entrance)
- One of the most visited national parks in the country, with alpine lakes, wildlife viewing, and dramatic mountain scenery.
- **Highlights:** Trail Ridge Road (seasonal, weather dependent); alpine tundra and high-elevation hikes; wildlife such as elk and moose; short walks and longer backcountry hikes.
- **Seasonal cautions:** Timed entry reservations are often required (especially summer); weather changes quickly at elevation; snow can linger well into spring; early fall storms are common. Start early to avoid crowds and afternoon thunderstorms.

## [Eldora Mountain Resort](https://www.eldora.com)
- 🚗 ~35–45 minutes
- A small, local mountain that’s very popular with Boulder residents.
- **Highlights:** Downhill skiing and snowboarding (winter); Nordic skiing and snowshoeing; summer hiking and mountain biking.
- **Seasonal cautions:** Canyon roads can be icy or snowy in winter; parking and lift lines are busiest on weekends and powder days. Check road and weather conditions before heading up Boulder Canyon.

## [Nederland](https://nederlandco.org)
- 🚗 ~25–30 minutes
- A quirky mountain town perched above Boulder with a strong arts and music culture.
- **Highlights:** Small shops, cafés, and breweries; live music and festivals; access to nearby trails and alpine lakes.
- **Seasonal cautions:** Higher elevation means colder temperatures and more snow; roads can be slick in winter; limited dining hours outside peak seasons.

## [Denver](https://www.denver.org) highlights
- 🚗 ~40–60 minutes (depending on traffic)
- Denver offers a very different experience from Boulder — bigger, busier, and more urban.
- **Popular options:** Museums and cultural institutions; professional sports events; concerts and performing arts; diverse dining neighborhoods; [Union Station](https://unionstationindenver.com) and downtown districts.
- **Seasonal cautions:** Traffic can be heavy during rush hour and event nights; parking downtown can be limited; transit or rideshare may be easier.
