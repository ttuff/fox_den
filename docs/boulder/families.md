## Quick version
- Boulder Creek Path and city parks offer easy walks and playgrounds.
- Valmont Bike Park and Scott Carpenter Park are top hits for active kids.
- Many restaurants around Pearl Street are casual and stroller-friendly.
- Bring layers and sun protection—weather swings fast (see weather-altitude.md).
- Consider earlier meals; popular spots get busy after 6pm.

## Parks & playtime
- Boulder Creek Path has multiple playgrounds and picnic spots.
- Scott Carpenter Park: splash area in summer, sledding hills in winter.
- Valmont Bike Park: pump tracks and beginner zones; helmets required.
- Boulder Reservoir (seasonal) for swimming areas and rentals.

## Family dining
- Pearl Street and North Boulder have relaxed patios where kids can roam.
- Many cafes offer kids’ menus or simple staples; counter-service speeds things up.
- For takeout, check (food-coffee.md) for neighborhoods with quick options.

## Rainy or cold-day ideas
- Museums and indoor play spaces near downtown and campus.
- Public libraries host story times and have great kids’ sections.
- Short scenic drives toward Nederland or Estes Park if roads are clear.

## Gear & logistics

- Pack extra layers and water for altitude; see (weather-altitude.md) for more tips.
- Baby supplies available at major grocers and pharmacies—see (groceries-essentials.md).
