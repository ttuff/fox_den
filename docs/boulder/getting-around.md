# Getting around

Quick ways to navigate Boulder and the region without stress.

## Parking (property-specific)
- **Where to park for this home:** see [Parking](../house/parking.md) for on-site and street guidance.
- Important Boulder note: Some neighborhoods use Neighborhood Parking Permits (NPP) and/or timed parking zones. If your vehicle is parked where permits are required, you can be ticketed even in residential areas.
- Busy times: On CU event weekends (football, graduation), parking enforcement and scarcity increase. Plan accordingly.
- Quick tip: If you’re unsure whether a spot is legal, take 10 seconds to check nearby signs (parking zones change quickly by block).

## Biking (very Boulder)
Boulder is one of the most bike-friendly cities in the U.S., with dedicated bike lanes and a strong network of multi-use paths.

- **City resources:** The City maintains an interactive Boulder Bike Map showing bike lanes, routes, and multi-use paths. The Boulder Creek Path is a major east-west corridor that connects many neighborhoods and destinations.
- **Bike share:** Boulder BCycle is the local bike-share system (stations around town; great for errands and casual rides).
- **Safety & etiquette:** Use lights at night, lock your bike well, and expect pedestrians on shared paths. In winter, paths can be icy in shaded sections.

## Public transit overview (local + regional)
Boulder has a mix of city-supported routes and regional RTD service. You can plan trips and track buses in real time using RTD tools and common transit apps.

- **Local Boulder routes:** HOP is a popular local route connecting key areas including CU/downtown-style destinations; the City provides fare and route info and publishes timetables. Boulder’s transit system is designed to connect neighborhoods with local and regional destinations.
- **Regional routes (Denver & beyond):** Flatiron Flyer (FF routes) is RTD’s fast, frequent service between Boulder and the Denver metro via US-36, with multiple route options (FF1, FF2, etc.). Pro tip: If you’re going downtown Denver, a common pattern is Flatiron Flyer → Denver Union Station, then walk/train from there.

## Rideshare & taxis (Uber/Lyft tips)
Rideshare is widely available in Boulder, but surge pricing can be real during CU event evenings, snowstorms, and peak airport travel windows.

- If you’re headed to a trailhead or canyon, confirm cell service for your pickup location (some areas are spotty).
- For early flights, schedule a ride ahead when possible.

## Airport transportation (Denver International Airport – DEN)
- **RTD SkyRide Bus: AB1.** RTD’s AB1 provides bus service between Boulder and Denver International Airport (DEN) (check schedules for your exact stop/time). RTD airport travel uses an Airport Fare (RTD lists an Airport Day Pass option). Always check the latest schedule before travel.
- **Driving:** Driving to DEN is straightforward but can be impacted by snow/ice, wind events, and peak traffic windows.
- **Rideshare / private shuttle:** Great for groups or very early departures; pricing varies widely by time and demand.

## Bonus Boulder tip: trailhead parking fees
Some City of Boulder Open Space trailheads require parking permits/fees for vehicles not registered in Boulder County (and certain areas are explicitly listed by the city). If you’re driving to popular trailheads, check ahead so you don’t get surprised.
