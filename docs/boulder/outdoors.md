## Close-in trail ideas
- **Chautauqua Park:** Multiple loop options to the Flatirons; busy on weekends.
- **Mount Sanitas:** Steep main route with a gentler valley trail descent.

## Parks & play areas
- Eben G. Fine Park and Scott Carpenter Park for picnics and playgrounds.
- Valmont Bike Park for pump tracks and skills areas (helmets recommended).
- Many neighborhood parks have shaded playgrounds; check city maps for the closest option.

## Safety & etiquette
- Hydrate early, especially at altitude; take breaks in summer heat.
- Yield to uphill hikers; keep dogs leashed where required and pack out waste.
- Weather changes quickly—carry a light rain layer and traction in winter.
- Respect closures for wildlife or muddy trails to prevent damage.
