# Weather & altitude

Prep for mountain weather and elevation shifts.

## Quick version
- Altitude ~5,400 ft: hydrate, go easy first day.
- Sun is strong year-round—sunscreen and hats help.
- Evenings cool fast; pack layers even in summer.
- Winter: icy sidewalks common; traction cleats help.
- Thunderstorms can roll in quickly; check radar before hikes.

## Altitude tips
- Drink water early and often; limit alcohol first night if altitude-sensitive.
- Light walk on (getting-around.md) paths before bigger hikes.
- If feeling lightheaded, rest, hydrate, and head to lower effort.

## Seasonal packing
- **Summer:** sun shirt/hat, light rain shell, reusable water bottle.
- **Fall:** warm layer for mornings/evenings; expect quick temperature swings.
- **Winter:** gloves, beanie, traction for ice, and a warm midlayer.
- **Spring:** waterproof shoes for slush/mud; storms are hit-or-miss.

## Weather watch
- Check hourly forecast before trail plans—see (outdoors.md) for ideas.
- Afternoon lightning is common in summer; avoid peaks if storms are possible.
- Snowmelt makes trails muddy; follow posted closures to protect them.

## Staying comfortable
- Humidifiers help if you’re new to the dry climate.
- Lip balm and moisturizer prevent chapped skin.
- Refill bottles at parks, cafes, or trailheads when available.
