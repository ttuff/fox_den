# Check-in

Fast pointers for arrival and getting settled.

## Quick version
- Check-in window: see your Airbnb itinerary for the exact time.
- Self check-in with the smart lock; code arrives in your Airbnb messages. [Provided in Airbnb message after booking]
- Park in approved spots before unloading (see [Parking](parking.md)).
- Hop on Wi-Fi right away (see [Wi-Fi & TV](wifi-tv.md)).
- Quiet hours start at 10 pm; keep voices low when arriving late.
- If anything feels off, start with [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) or message us on Airbnb.

## Details
- **Arrival timing:** The Airbnb booking shows your check-in time. If you’re early, we’ll confirm if drop-off is possible once cleaning is done.
- **Entry:** Use the smart lock code shared via Airbnb on arrival day. Make sure the door fully latches before leaving; the deadbolt needs a snug close.
- **Parking:** Use driveway or marked guest spots per the [Parking map](parking.md). Avoid blocking neighbors or shared access lanes.
- **First steps:** 
  - Connect to Wi-Fi (details in [Wi-Fi & TV](wifi-tv.md)).
  - Thermostat is preset for comfort; adjust gently a degree or two at a time.
  - Review the [House rules](house-rules.md) to keep everything running smoothly.
- **Late arrivals:** Please keep outside voices low and close doors softly; neighbors appreciate it.

## FAQs
- **Can I arrive early?** We’ll try to help once cleaning is complete. Message us in Airbnb for same-day updates.
- **What if the lock code doesn’t work?** Confirm you’re using the code from Airbnb for today, then see [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) for quick resets.
- **Can friends visit?** Daytime visitors are fine within the reservation’s occupancy; overnights need to be on the booking per Airbnb rules.
