# House rules

Stay-friendly guidelines to keep the visit smooth.

## Quick version
- Follow Airbnb occupancy and guest count; no unregistered overnights.
- Quiet hours: 10 pm–8 am inside and out.
- No smoking, vaping, or incense indoors.
- No parties or large events.
- Pets only if pre-approved in Airbnb messages.
- Keep food/drink in kitchen/dining areas; wipe spills promptly.
- Respect neighbors—close doors gently and park considerately (see [Parking](parking.md)).

## Details
- **Occupancy:** Only guests on the Airbnb booking may stay overnight. Visitors are welcome during the day within reason.
- **Noise:** Keep music/TV at conversational levels, especially after 10 pm. Outdoor decks/patios should be quiet during quiet hours.
- **Smoking:** Not allowed indoors. If smoking outside, keep 15 ft from the house and dispose of waste safely.
- **Pets:** Allowed only with prior host approval; pick up waste immediately and keep pets off beds and sofas when possible.
- **Care of the home:** Use coasters, cutting boards, and placemats to avoid damage. Report spills or broken items right away so we can help.
- **Climate:** Please avoid drastic thermostat changes; small adjustments work best for the system.
- **Safety:** Lock doors/windows when leaving, and store packages inside if delivered during your stay.

## FAQs
- **Can we host a dinner?** A small meal with your group is fine. Larger gatherings or celebrations are not permitted.
- **Is there quiet time enforcement?** Yes—persistent noise complaints can lead to cancellation per Airbnb policy.
- **Where do I put trash?** Use the kitchen bins; larger bags can go to the outdoor bins by the driveway. Collection is mid-week—if you’re here then, please roll bins to the curb the night before.
