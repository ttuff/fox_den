# House rules

Stay-friendly guidelines to keep the visit smooth and aligned with Boulder expectations.

## How rules are set
Rules for this home come from three independent sources:
- **Airbnb platform rules:** Global policies set and enforced by Airbnb.
- **City of Boulder laws:** Local regulations enforced by the City of Boulder, including police and code enforcement.
- **House rules:** Part of your booking agreement and enforced by us, with Airbnb’s support.

Violating any one of these can affect a stay — even if the other two are being followed. We’ve tried to be clear so there are no surprises.

## Core rules
- Registered guests only — no unlisted visitors.
- Maximum occupancy: **8 people**.
- No smoking inside or on the property.
- Pet policy: no pets.
- Respect neighbors, shared spaces, and the property.
- Follow Airbnb policies and all applicable local laws.

## No parties or events (Airbnb policy)
Airbnb has a strict, platform-wide no-party and no-events policy, and we fully enforce it at this home. This policy applies regardless of local law and is one of the most important conditions of your stay.

**Parties and events are not allowed.** A “party” is defined by behavior, not by the number of guests. Examples include:
- Amplified music or sound systems
- Gatherings that draw attention from neighbors
- Visitors who are not listed on the reservation
- Event-style use of the home (celebrations, pre-game gatherings, group meetups)

Violations of this policy may result in immediate cancellation of the stay without refund, in accordance with Airbnb policy.

## Noise & neighborhood expectations (City of Boulder)
This home is located in a quiet residential neighborhood close to the University of Colorado. Boulder is a college town, and noise and nuisance rules are actively enforced, especially in neighborhoods near campus.

**Daytime & nighttime noise rules**
- **Daytime / Evening:** 7:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m. Amplified sound (music, speakers, outdoor audio) that can be clearly heard far beyond the property — including down the block — can be a violation, even during the daytime.
- **Nighttime / Quiet Hours:** 11:00 p.m. – 7:00 a.m. Noise is enforced much more strictly. Even relatively low levels of amplified sound that travel off the property can result in complaints or citations.

Additional things to know:
- Amplified outdoor sound is especially likely to cause issues
- Noise complaints often come from neighbors, not just police patrols
- Repeated complaints at a property can escalate into formal nuisance enforcement by the city
- Sound travels farther than expected in Boulder, especially outdoors and at elevation

Because of this, we ask guests to:
- Keep music low indoors at all times
- Avoid amplified sound outdoors entirely
- Close windows when playing audio
- Be especially mindful in the evening and at night

Please plan celebrations, pre-game gatherings, or group meetups at restaurants, breweries, or event venues. This home is best used as a calm place to relax and recharge.

## College-town context & occupancy
This home is located close to the University of Colorado Boulder, in a residential neighborhood that includes families, long-term residents, and university staff. During certain times of year — including football weekends, graduation, move-in and move-out periods, and parents weekends — the neighborhood is especially sensitive to noise, gatherings, and parking. City enforcement and neighbor vigilance tend to increase during these times.

Colorado law prohibits cities from enforcing occupancy limits based on whether guests are related to one another. As a result, the City of Boulder no longer enforces “unrelated person” caps. For safety and comfort, we limit occupancy to **eight (8) people**. We ask guests to respect this limit as part of the conditions of their stay.

If you’re ever unsure whether something might be an issue, please reach out. We’re always happy to clarify and would much rather answer a quick question than have a problem later. Thank you for helping us care for this home and the neighborhood.
