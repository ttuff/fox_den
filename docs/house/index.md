## Neighborhood context

This is a quiet, residential Boulder neighborhood with a mix of families, students, and long-time locals. You’ll see people walking dogs, biking, and heading to campus.

We aim to be good neighbors and appreciate guests who do the same:
- Keep outdoor noise low in the evenings.
- Use street and driveway parking courteously.
- Secure trash bins and outdoor items when winds pick up.

Thank you — this helps the neighborhood stay calm and welcoming.
