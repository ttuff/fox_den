# Kitchen, coffee & waste

We want the kitchen to feel easy and comfortable — whether you’re making a quick espresso or a slow morning cup of coffee.

## Coffee & morning basics
We provide two coffee options so you can choose what fits your morning.

### Grind & pour-over coffee
For a classic, slower-brewed cup.
1. Add whole beans to the grinder and grind to a medium setting.
2. Place a filter in the pour-over cone and add ground coffee.
3. Slowly pour hot water over the grounds in a circular motion.

Supplies are located:
- Coffee beans and filters: [location]
- Grinder: [counter / cabinet]
- Electric kettle: [location]

### Espresso (Nescafé pod machine – white)
For quick espresso drinks.
1. Fill the water reservoir.
2. Insert a Nescafé pod.
3. Close the lid firmly.
4. Press the espresso or lungo button.
5. Wait for the cycle to finish before opening.

Notes:
- Please use Nescafé-compatible pods only.
- Do not force the lid.
- Used pods can go in trash or compost depending on pod type.
- Pods are stored [location].

## Cooking & kitchen supplies
- Pots, pans, and basic cooking tools are stored in [drawers/cabinets].
- Pantry staples (salt, pepper, oil, etc.) are in [location].
- Feel free to use what’s available and leave items as you found them.

## Dishwasher basics
- Dishwasher detergent pods are stored [location].
- Please scrape food into the compost or trash before loading.
- Load dishes securely and select a normal cycle.
- It’s fine to run the dishwasher when full — no need to hand-wash unless you prefer.

## Trash, recycling & compost
Boulder takes waste sorting seriously — thanks for helping us keep things simple and correct.

- **Trash:** Non-recyclable waste, wrappers, plastic film. Indoor bin: pull-out under the kitchen sink. Outdoor cart: in the alley-side enclosure behind the house.
- **Recycling:** Clean paper, cardboard, cans, glass bottles, rigid plastics. Please rinse containers. Indoor bin: tall bin next to the pantry cabinet. Outdoor cart: in the alley-side enclosure behind the house.
- **Compost:** Food scraps, coffee grounds, paper towels, napkins. Indoor bin: small lidded caddy on the counter; empty into the outdoor compost cart in the alley-side enclosure behind the house.
- **Extra bags/liners:** Lower drawer to the right of the sink.

If you’re unsure, trash is better than contaminating recycling or compost — no stress.

**Quick-sort cheatsheet**
- Clean pizza box: recycle; greasy pizza box: compost.
- Plastic bags, film, bubble mailers: trash (do not place in recycling).
- Broken glass and ceramics: trash (they can’t be recycled curbside).
- Coffee pods: compostable if labeled; otherwise trash.
- Paper towels and napkins: compost.

### Pickup schedule
- **Have bins at the curb by 7:00 AM every Friday** (trucks usually arrive in the afternoon).
- **Trash:** every Friday (weekly).
- **Recycling & compost:** alternate Fridays (one week recycling, the next week compost).
- Set carts at the **alley curb cut** (not the front street) with lids closed and space for the truck arm.
- Check the neighborhood pickup calendar here: [Schedule]({{ SCHEDULE_URL }}).

**Pickup day checklist**
- Night before: empty indoor bins into the correct outdoor carts and tie bags securely.
- Roll out only the carts scheduled that week (trash every week + either recycling or compost) to the alley curb cut.
- Space carts apart and keep lids fully closed; remove any parked bikes/gear blocking access.
- Morning of: confirm carts are out by 7:00 AM and lids are shut tight.
- After pickup: bring carts back to the alley enclosure the same day.

**If bins are full or you missed pickup**
- Consolidate and compress bagged trash to make space; keep lids closing fully.
- If still full, leave tied bags neatly beside the enclosure until the next pickup.
- Missed pickup: leave carts out at the alley curb cut; service usually comes the next day.
- If they haven’t come by the following morning, bring carts back and try again the next scheduled day.

**Holiday weeks**
- Service typically runs **one day late** on holiday weeks; set out bins the day after the usual pickup day.

### A small local note
Composting and recycling are part of everyday life in Boulder. We don’t expect perfection — just a reasonable effort. Thanks for helping us care for the home and community. If anything in the kitchen isn’t clear or isn’t working as expected, please reach out — we’re happy to help.
