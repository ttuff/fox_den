# Kitchen, coffee & waste

We want the kitchen to feel easy and comfortable — whether you’re making a quick espresso or a slow morning cup of coffee.

## Coffee & morning basics
We provide two coffee options so you can choose what fits your morning.

### Grind & pour-over coffee
For a classic, slower-brewed cup.
1. Add whole beans to the grinder and grind to a medium setting.
2. Place a filter in the pour-over cone and add ground coffee.
3. Slowly pour hot water over the grounds in a circular motion.

Supplies are located:
- Coffee beans and filters: [location]
- Grinder: [counter / cabinet]
- Electric kettle: [location]

### Espresso (Nescafé pod machine – white)
For quick espresso drinks.
1. Fill the water reservoir.
2. Insert a Nescafé pod.
3. Close the lid firmly.
4. Press the espresso or lungo button.
5. Wait for the cycle to finish before opening.

Notes:
- Please use Nescafé-compatible pods only.
- Do not force the lid.
- Used pods can go in trash or compost depending on pod type.
- Pods are stored [location].

## Cooking & kitchen supplies
- Pots, pans, and basic cooking tools are stored in [drawers/cabinets].
- Pantry staples (salt, pepper, oil, etc.) are in [location].
- Feel free to use what’s available and leave items as you found them.

## Dishwasher basics
- Dishwasher detergent pods are stored [location].
- Please scrape food into the compost or trash before loading.
- Load dishes securely and select a normal cycle.
- It’s fine to run the dishwasher when full — no need to hand-wash unless you prefer.

## Trash, recycling & compost
Boulder takes waste sorting seriously — thanks for helping us keep things simple and correct.

If you’re unsure, trash is always okay — no stress.

### Pickup schedule
Trash / Recycling / Compost pickup: [day(s) of week]. If your stay overlaps a pickup day, we appreciate help placing bins [curb / alley] if convenient — but this is not required.

### A small local note
Composting and recycling are part of everyday life in Boulder. We don’t expect perfection — just a reasonable effort. Thanks for helping us care for the home and community. If anything in the kitchen isn’t clear or isn’t working as expected, please reach out — we’re happy to help.
