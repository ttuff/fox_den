# Parking

Where to park for this home and how to avoid tickets.

## Quick version
- **Primary parking:** [Driveway / designated spot / garage] — [how many cars].
- **Street parking:** [Allowed / limited / permit zone].
- **Do not park:** [block driveways / in front of hydrants / over sidewalks / “No Parking” signed zones].
- Busy times: On CU event weekends (football, graduation), parking enforcement and scarcity increase. Plan accordingly.
- If you’re unsure whether a spot is legal, take 10 seconds to check nearby signs (parking zones change quickly by block).

## Details
- **Important Boulder note:** Some neighborhoods use Neighborhood Parking Permits (NPP) and/or timed parking zones. If your vehicle is parked where permits are required, you can be ticketed even in residential areas.
- **Trailhead trips:** Some City of Boulder Open Space trailheads require parking permits/fees for vehicles not registered in Boulder County. Check ahead so you don’t get surprised.
- **Shared areas:** Do not block sidewalks, alleys, or neighboring driveways. Keep a clear path for trash pickup.
- **Snow/ice:** In winter, check around tires before driving off; we keep a shovel and ice melt by the porch.
