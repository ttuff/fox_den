# Parking

Where to park and how to avoid tickets.

## Quick version
- Use the driveway or spaces marked for guests; avoid blocking neighbors.
- Street parking is limited—check signage for street sweeping or permits.
- The parking diagram in your Airbnb messages shows approved spots.
- Unload quickly, then move cars to approved spaces.
- No idling with windows open near the house at night.

## Details
- **Primary parking:** Driveway spots are first choice. If another car is present, stagger so both vehicles can exit without moving the other.
- **Street rules:** Obey any posted time limits and sweeping days; tickets are the guest’s responsibility.
- **Shared areas:** Do not block sidewalks, alleys, or neighboring driveways. Keep a clear path for trash pickup.
- **EV charging:** Not available on-site; nearest public chargers are in central Boulder. Bring your own adapter if you plan to use public stations.
- **Snow/ice:** In winter, check around tires before driving off; we keep a shovel and ice melt by the porch.

## FAQs
- **Can oversized vehicles fit?** Standard SUVs/minivans fit in the driveway. For trucks/vans, use street parking where legal.
- **Is overnight street parking allowed?** Usually, yes—just follow posted signs and avoid blocking mailboxes or hydrants.
- **Where is bike storage?** Bikes can be locked to the porch railing; do not bring them inside to avoid scuffs.
