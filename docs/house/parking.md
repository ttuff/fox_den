Where to park for this home and how to avoid tickets.

## Quick version
- **Driveway (~15 ft):** Fits two small cars or one large car.
- **Street parking:** Available on the street; no permit required unless posted on the block.
- **Do not park:** Avoid blocking driveways, hydrants, sidewalks, or “No Parking” signed zones.
- Busy times: On CU event weekends (football, graduation), parking enforcement and scarcity increase. Plan accordingly.
- If you’re unsure whether a spot is legal, take 10 seconds to check nearby signs (parking zones change quickly by block).

## Details
- **Driveway:** The driveway is about 15 feet long; it fits **two small cars or one large car** without overhanging the sidewalk.
- **Street parking:** On-street parking is available and does not require a permit in this neighborhood unless the block has posted restrictions.
- **Trailhead trips:** Some City of Boulder Open Space trailheads require parking permits/fees for vehicles not registered in Boulder County. Check ahead so you don’t get surprised.
- **Shared areas:** Do not block sidewalks, alleys, or neighboring driveways. Keep a clear path for trash pickup.
- **Snow/ice:** In winter, check around tires before driving off; we keep a shovel and ice melt by the porch.

## Street parking rules (Boulder)
- Move vehicles so they are not in the same on-street spot for **72 hours** straight to avoid ticket/tow risk.
- Holiday and special-event signage may override general rules; follow posted signs if present.
- Do not block sidewalks, driveways, hydrants, or mailboxes.

## RVs & oversized vehicles
- RVs, campers, trailers, and oversized vehicles are not suitable for long-term street storage in Boulder; they may be ticketed if left too long, so plan to move them frequently and comply with posted rules.
