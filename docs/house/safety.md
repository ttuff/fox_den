# Safety

Safety basics and emergency pointers.

## Quick version
- For emergencies, dial 911 first, then message us via Airbnb.
- Fire extinguisher under the kitchen sink; first-aid kit in the hallway closet.
- Smoke/CO alarms are installed—do not disable them.
- Know exits: front door and back patio slider.
- Keep walkways clear of snow/ice; use provided ice melt if needed.
- If you smell gas or see sparks, leave immediately and call 911 from outside.

## Details
- **Emergency contacts:** Call 911 for fire, medical, or safety issues. After help is on the way, message us via Airbnb with details and your callback number.
- **Alarms:** The home has smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. If one chirps, it may need a battery—message us.
- **Fire safety:** Fire extinguisher is under the kitchen sink. For small grease fires, smother with a lid and turn off heat—do not use water.
- **First aid:** Supplies are in the hallway closet; restock requests are welcome.
- **Weather:** In winter, use the provided shovel and ice melt (by the porch) to keep steps safe. During storms, secure patio items to prevent wind damage.
- **Windows/doors:** Lock doors and windows when you leave, especially at night. Use window stops on ground-floor windows if provided.

## FAQs
- **Where is the breaker panel?** In the utility closet—see [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) for reset steps.
- **What if an alarm sounds?** Evacuate, call 911, then contact us. If it’s a low-battery chirp, message us for a replacement.
- **Is there a baby/child setup?** The home is not baby-proofed; keep breakables out of reach and supervise children closely.
