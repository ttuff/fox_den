## Wildfire

Wildfire is a normal part of Colorado’s Front Range environment, and the area is supported by **extensive public safety systems** at the local, county, and state level. Most wildfire activity does **not** affect day-to-day life, but it’s important to know where to get accurate information and what to do if conditions change.

**Fire weather & warnings**
- On hot, dry, and windy days you may hear about **Red Flag Warning** days. These are issued by weather agencies when conditions could allow fires to start or spread more easily.
- Red Flag days are **not an emergency by themselves** — they are an early warning to be cautious and to stay informed.

**Where to get official information**

  OEM website: https://www.boulderoem.com

**Smoke vs. wildfire evacuation (important)**
- **Smoke in the air does NOT mean you need to evacuate.**

- Evacuation is only required if an **official evacuation order** is issued for this specific area.

**What to do if there is a wildfire nearby**
- If there is **no evacuation order**, you do not need to leave.
- If an **evacuation order is issued**, leave immediately and follow the directions in the alert.
- Evacuation notices clearly state **when to evacuate and where to go** (safe routes or shelters).
- Do not wait to assess conditions yourself — official orders are conservative and designed to keep people safe.

**If evacuation is required**
- Take essentials only (ID, phone, wallet, medications).
- Close windows and doors if time allows.
- Follow posted evacuation routes and instructions from authorities.

Wildfires are closely monitored here, and evacuation orders are **rare but taken very seriously** when they occur.

## Wind

Strong winds are common in this area and are a normal part of Front Range weather patterns. The house is built for these conditions and **regularly withstands windstorms without issue**.

- The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), located about **½ mile away**, is the official local reference point for wind speed and weather observations.
- Windstorms can **mobilize loose outdoor items** such as furniture, branches, trash bins, and lightweight objects.

**During high-wind events**
- Avoid being outside during peak wind — **flying debris can be dangerous**.
- Secure or move lightweight outdoor items inside.
- Keep windows closed.

**What to expect**
- Wind can be loud, especially at night.
- Brief power outages are uncommon but possible during extreme wind events; service is usually restored quickly.

Wind here can feel intense if you’re not used to it, but it is **well-understood, well-monitored**, and part of normal life in Boulder.
