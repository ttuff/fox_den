## Severe weather, power, & environmental conditions
Boulder experiences a range of environmental conditions. While most days are mild, severe weather does occur.

**Wind & storms**
- Boulder can experience extreme wind events, with gusts occasionally exceeding 100 mph during major storms.
- Strong winds may impact power, internet, and outdoor conditions.

**Power & internet outages**
- Power outages can affect heating and cooling systems.
- If you lose power, we have also lost power at our home next door.
- If you lose internet, we have also lost internet at our home and office.
- Because we are on site, we will typically be aware of outages quickly and will communicate updates as soon as possible.

**Wildfire & air quality**
- Wildfire season varies year to year and can affect air quality.
- Air quality alerts and outdoor burning bans may be issued by the city or county.
- This home is hardened for wind and wildfire, reflecting the conditions we experience most often in Boulder.

We monitor conditions closely and will work hard to make sure you are informed if severe weather is approaching and action may be needed. However, guests are ultimately responsible for staying aware of weather conditions and official alerts during their stay.

## Host support during urgent situations
For non-life-threatening but urgent issues (water leaks, power loss, lock issues, safety concerns):

- Please contact us via Airbnb messaging as soon as possible.
- Because we live on site, we can often respond quickly or help coordinate next steps.

For emergencies involving immediate danger, always call 911 first, then notify us when safe to do so.

We hope this information helps you feel prepared and at ease. If you have any questions about safety, exits, or local conditions, please don’t hesitate to ask — we’re happy to help.
