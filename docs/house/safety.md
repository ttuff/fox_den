## Wildfire

Wildfire is a normal part of Colorado’s Front Range environment, and the area is supported by **extensive public safety systems** at the local, county, and state level. Most wildfire activity does **not** affect day-to-day life, but it’s important to know where to get accurate information and what to do if conditions change.

**Fire weather & warnings**
- On hot, dry, and windy days you may hear about **Red Flag Warning** days. These are issued by weather agencies when conditions could allow fires to start or spread more easily.
- Red Flag days are **not an emergency by themselves** — they are an early warning to be cautious and to stay informed.

**Where to get official information**
- **Boulder Office of Emergency Management (OEM):** official local alerts, evacuation notices, and updates  
  OEM website: **PASTE_BOULDER_OEM_URL_HERE**
- **ReadyColorado:** statewide emergency preparedness and guidance  
  https://www.readycolorado.com
- **Air quality & smoke conditions:**  
  https://www.airnow.gov
- Guests should rely on **official alerts and notices**, not social media rumors.
- If there is a situation affecting the house directly, we will also message guests with verified updates.

**Sign up for alerts (recommended)**
- If you will be staying for more than a short visit, consider signing up for **Boulder emergency alerts** via the OEM website above.
- Alerts are location-based and provide clear instructions if action is needed.

**Smoke vs. wildfire evacuation (important)**
- **Smoke in the air does NOT mean you need to evacuate.**
- Smoke can travel long distances from fires that are many miles away.
- Evacuation is only required if an **official evacuation order** is issued for this specific area.

**What to do if there is a wildfire nearby**
- If there is **no evacuation order**, you do not need to leave.
- If an **evacuation order is issued**, leave immediately and follow the directions in the alert.
- Evacuation notices clearly state **when to evacuate and where to go** (safe routes or shelters).
- Do not wait to assess conditions yourself — official orders are conservative and designed to keep people safe.

**If evacuation is required**
- Take essentials only (ID, phone, wallet, medications).
- Close windows and doors if time allows.
- Follow posted evacuation routes and instructions from authorities.

Wildfires are closely monitored here, and evacuation orders are **rare but taken very seriously** when they occur.

## Wind

Strong winds are common in this area and are a normal part of Front Range weather patterns. The house is built for these conditions and **regularly withstands windstorms without issue**.

- The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), located about **½ mile away**, is the official local reference point for wind speed and weather observations.
- Windstorms can **mobilize loose outdoor items** such as furniture, branches, trash bins, and lightweight objects.

**During high-wind events**
- Avoid being outside during peak wind — **flying debris can be dangerous**.
- Secure or move lightweight outdoor items inside.
- Keep windows closed.

**What to expect**
- Wind can be loud, especially at night.
- Brief power outages are uncommon but possible during extreme wind events; service is usually restored quickly.

Wind here can feel intense if you’re not used to it, but it is **well-understood, well-monitored**, and part of normal life in Boulder.

## Winter power outages

Power outages in Boulder are **uncommon** and usually **short-lived**, even during winter storms or high-wind events. Local utilities are experienced with these conditions and restoration is typically quick.

**What to expect**
- Most outages last **minutes to a few hours**.
- Extended outages are rare.
- The house retains heat well for short outages, especially if doors and windows remain closed.

**If the power goes out**
- Stay inside and keep doors and windows closed to retain heat.
- Avoid opening the refrigerator or freezer unless necessary.
- Use battery-powered lights if needed (flashlights are safer than candles).

If an outage lasts longer than expected or there is a broader issue affecting the neighborhood, we will message guests with updates when available.

## Smoke & air quality (without evacuation)

During wildfire season, you may occasionally notice **smoke or haze** in the air even when there is **no nearby fire**. Smoke can travel long distances and does not mean you are in danger.

**Important clarification**
- **Smoke does NOT mean evacuation.**
- Evacuation is only required if an **official evacuation order** is issued for this area.

**What to do on smoky days**
- Keep windows and doors closed.
- Run indoor ventilation or air filtration if available.
- Limit strenuous outdoor activity if smoke levels are high.

**Check current air quality**
- https://www.airnow.gov

Smoke events can be uncomfortable but are usually temporary and closely monitored by public agencies.

If you are unsure what to do in a weather, wind, fire, or smoke situation:

1. **Check official alerts first** (local emergency management or weather alerts).
2. If there is **no evacuation order**, you do not need to leave.
3. If an **official evacuation order** is issued, follow it immediately.
4. If something seems unclear or concerning, **message us** — we are happy to help you interpret official guidance.
