# Troubleshooting

Quick fixes for common issues.

## Quick version
- Wi-Fi or TV acting up? Reboot modem/router, then the TV (see [Wi-Fi & TV](wifi-tv.md)).
- Smart lock unhappy? Check for a solid door close, then re-enter your code. [Provided in Airbnb message after booking]
- AC/heat slow? Adjust 1–2° and give it 10–15 minutes.
- Power out? Check breakers in the utility closet before messaging us.
- Still stuck? Message through Airbnb with a photo or short note.

## Details
- **Wi-Fi drops:** Unplug the router and modem for 30 seconds, plug back in modem first, wait 2 minutes, then router. Reconnect to Wi-Fi using credentials from Airbnb.
- **TV issues:** If apps freeze, hold the power button on the TV/remote for a soft reboot. Verify you’re on the correct input if using HDMI.
- **Smart lock:** Ensure the door is fully shut and aligned. Re-enter the day’s code; if it flashes red, remove gloves or wipe the keypad and try again.
- **HVAC:** Thermostat changes can take a few minutes. If the system doesn’t respond, check that mode (heat/cool) matches the season and that no windows are open.
- **Hot water:** Run the tap for 60–90 seconds; the heater may need a moment. Avoid back-to-back showers if the tank is refilling.
- **Power:** For a partial outage, check the breaker panel in the utility closet. Reset any tripped breakers by turning them fully off then on.

## FAQs
- **Where are extra linens?** Fresh linens and towels are in the hallway closet.
- **What if an appliance shows an error code?** Snap a photo and message us on Airbnb; include any sounds or flashing lights.
- **Does the house have a plunger?** Yes—under the bathroom sink.
