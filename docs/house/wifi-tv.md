# Quick start: Wi‑Fi, TV & house basics

This page covers the basics so you can settle in quickly. If anything isn’t clear or doesn’t work as expected, please reach out — we’re happy to help.

## Wi‑Fi
- **Network:** _____________________
- **Password:** _____________________
- Wi‑Fi works throughout the house and is suitable for streaming and video calls.
- If the internet goes down, we typically experience the same outage next door and will be aware quickly.

## TV & Roku (Guest Mode)

The TV uses **Roku Guest Mode**, which is designed specifically for short-term stays and protects your privacy.

**How it works**
- When you turn on the TV, Roku will ask you to **enter your checkout date**.
- After that date, **all personal information and app logins are automatically deleted**.
- This allows you to safely sign in to your own streaming apps during your stay.

**Watching TV**
- You’re welcome to log in to your favorite streaming services.
- If you don’t want to log in, Roku also offers **free live and on-demand programming** that does not require an account.

**Privacy**
- No accounts, passwords, or viewing history are retained after your stay.
- Guest Mode resets automatically based on the checkout date you enter.

If anything about the TV setup is unclear, feel free to message us and we’re happy to help.

## Thermostat & temperature
- The house uses an ecobee smart thermostat.
- Tap the screen to wake it up; use the up/down arrows to adjust the temperature.
- You’re welcome to adjust it for comfort. Temperature ranges are set within reasonable limits; if something feels off, just let us know.
- Boulder note: Wind and rapid weather changes can affect indoor temperature — the system may take a bit of time to respond.

## Hot water
- Hot water is available throughout the house; normal showers and household use are no problem.
- If multiple long showers are taken back-to-back, recovery may take some time.
- If you ever notice a loss of hot water, please message us.

## Washer & dryer
- Washer and dryer are located [location].
- Detergent is provided [location].
- Please clean the lint trap before using the dryer.
- If you’re unsure about settings, a normal cycle works well for most loads.

## Lighting & switches
- Some switches control outlets or lamps rather than overhead lights.
- A few switches may not appear to do anything — this is normal in older homes.
- Outdoor and hallway lighting may be on timers or sensors.
- If you can’t find a light you expect, just ask.

## Doors & locks
- Entry uses a keypad with a unique code for your stay.
- Please make sure doors are fully closed before leaving.

A quick reminder: this is a lived-in home in a residential neighborhood. If something feels confusing, unusual, or not quite right, please message us rather than guessing — we’d much rather help than have you worry.
