# Wi-Fi & TV

Connection details and streaming tips at a glance.

## Quick version
- Network name and password are in your Airbnb messages. [Provided in Airbnb message after booking]
- Best signal near the living room router; avoid unplugging it.
- Smart TV: use your streaming logins; sign out before checkout.
- HDMI port available for laptops/game consoles.
- If Wi-Fi drops, reboot router + modem (see [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)).
- Wired work? Use your own USB-C/HDMI adapter; desk area is by the window.

## Details
- **Wi-Fi:** Connect to the network info shared in Airbnb. Router sits in the living area—keep it clear of objects for best signal.
- **Speed tips:** For video calls, sit in the living room or the front bedroom for strongest coverage.
- **TV setup:**
  - Use the Home button to pick your app (Netflix, Hulu, etc.).
  - Guest Mode is preferred; otherwise sign out of all apps before you leave.
  - Want cable-style channels? Use the YouTube TV app already installed (log into your own account).
- **Casting:** The TV supports AirPlay/Chromecast from the same Wi-Fi network. If casting lags, restart the TV and router.
- **HDMI:** HDMI port is open; unplug any existing device and replug when done.

## FAQs
- **Why can’t I find the network?** Power-cycle the router (unplug for 30 seconds) and confirm you’re using the exact network name from Airbnb messages.
- **TV says “No signal.”** Make sure the correct HDMI/input is selected; if using apps, press Home to exit HDMI mode.
- **Is ethernet available?** Not at this time; Wi-Fi only.
