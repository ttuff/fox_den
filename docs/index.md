## Welcome to Boulder
We’re so glad you’re here. Welcome to your home base in Boulder — a place we hope feels comfortable, calm, and easy to settle into from the moment you arrive.

Boulder is a unique town. It’s an outdoor‑oriented, residential college community shaped by the University of Colorado, expansive open space and trail systems, and a strong culture of care for neighbors and shared spaces. Many people come here to hike, attend campus events, visit family, or spend time reconnecting with nature. Days in Boulder tend to be active and social; evenings are typically quieter and more relaxed.

This home is located in a quiet residential neighborhood, and we ask guests to treat it as a peaceful place to unwind after a full day exploring. Whether you’re coming back from the trails, a football game, a conference, or downtown Pearl Street, we hope this feels like a comfortable place to slow down, open the windows, and recharge.

## About your hosts
We’re your hosts, Kika and Ty, and we live right next door. We’re both scientists by training, with degrees in ecology and evolution, and Boulder has been our long‑term home. One of us runs a Boulder‑based science communication company focused on helping researchers share their work clearly and creatively, and the other is a scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder working with large environmental and climate datasets. Our work keeps us closely connected to the university, the outdoors, and the local community.

This property is special to us. Years ago, we became close friends with our neighbor and opened up the space between our homes by removing the fence and reimagining the shared backyard. We remodeled the old shed into what became the original headquarters of Impact Media Lab. After our neighbor passed away, we were able to keep both homes, and we now cherish the rare double lot — one house where we live, and this house, which we’re excited to share with visitors.

Because we live next door and share the backyard space, we’re often nearby. We’re happy to help with questions about the house, offer local recommendations, or troubleshoot small issues if they come up. At the same time, we’re very mindful of privacy and always aim to give guests plenty of space to enjoy their stay independently.

## How to use this pamphlet
This booklet is designed to make your stay as smooth and stress‑free as possible. Inside you’ll find:

- How the house works (Wi‑Fi, thermostat, kitchen, laundry, etc.)
- Important house rules and local expectations
- Boulder‑specific guidance on noise and neighborhood norms
- Suggestions for outdoor activities, food, and local spots

Some guidelines come from Airbnb, some come from the City of Boulder, and others reflect how we care for this home and the surrounding neighborhood. We’ve tried to be clear and transparent throughout so there are no surprises and you can relax knowing what to expect.

## Staying in touch
- **Preferred contact:** Airbnb messaging (this is the fastest and helps us keep everything in one place)
- We typically respond within a few hours during the day and evening.
- If something in the house isn’t working as expected or doesn’t meet expectations, please reach out during your stay — we can often fix things quickly and would much rather address issues in real time.
- You’re also welcome to email us if that’s easier for you: **Kika: Tuff.Kika@gmail.com**

## Feedback
We’re relatively new to hosting this home and are committed to making it a great experience for everyone who stays here. If something during your stay feels especially helpful, comfortable, or well thought out — or if there’s anything that could be improved — your comments and ratings truly help us learn and refine the experience for future guests. Even a short note goes a long way.

If something isn’t working while you’re here, please let us know right away so we can try to fix it in real time. If everything feels like a good fit, sharing that in a review helps future guests decide whether this place is right for them too. We really appreciate you being part of the early chapter of hosting this home.

## A walk around the neighborhood
One of the things we love most about this spot is how clearly it reflects Boulder itself — a mix of science, quiet residential life, everyday convenience, and fast access to the foothills. When you step outside, you’re not just near things — you’re in the rhythm of how locals actually live.

### Across Broadway: science as a neighbor
Directly across Broadway sit two major federal research campuses: NOAA and NIST. These aren’t parks or office complexes — they’re active research facilities that have helped shape Boulder’s identity as a science town. Climate science, atmospheric research, and national measurement standards all happen right there.

Because of that:
- Access to the grounds is limited
- Dogs are not allowed on campus
- Open lawns and interior paths are not public spaces

Locals tend to stay on the sidewalks, respect posted signs, and use nearby trail systems instead. It’s part of the quiet understanding of the neighborhood.

### Where the mountains begin (a local running tip)
This area is also a natural launch point into the foothills. From the house, you’ll notice how the landscape starts to open up almost immediately. One of the most common local routines — including ours — is to head out along the south fence line near the research campus perimeter and continue toward the mountains from there. It’s one of those very “Boulder” things: you can go from a residential street to a serious run or hike without ever getting in a car. If you want route ideas — flat, steep, short, or long — just ask.

### Everyday errands, the local way
A short distance away is the Table Mesa Shopping Center, which functions as a kind of neighborhood hub. This is where locals grab groceries, gas, coffee or quick meals. It’s also home to Tinker Art Studio, a creative space for kids and adults, and Petty John’s, which is widely considered the best nearby liquor store — known for great selection and genuinely helpful staff.

### Bikes, food, and getting around
Not far from there is the Basemar Shopping Center. In addition to food options, it has one of Boulder’s larger bike shops — a great resource if you’re interested in renting a bike, getting repairs, or asking about local riding conditions. Boulder is a bike town, and this is one of the places that keeps it moving.

### A place for kids to be kids
For families, Martin Park is nearby. It’s a relaxed neighborhood park with play structures and open space — nothing flashy, just a good place for kids to run, climb, and burn off energy in a way that feels very local.

### The school next door
Right next door is Halcyon School, a small K–12 school serving students with special needs. It’s a very small community — only around eight students — and contributes to the calm, respectful feel of the block. During school hours, things tend to stay especially quiet, and we appreciate helping keep that environment peaceful.

### The big picture
This neighborhood works because it balances a lot of things at once: quiet residential streets, national science institutions, kid-friendly spaces, easy errands, and quick access to nature. Once you get your bearings, it starts to feel less like a place you’re visiting and more like a place you understand. If you’d like help orienting yourself — where to walk, where to run, where to shop, or how to connect into the trail system — we’re always happy to point you in the right direction.
